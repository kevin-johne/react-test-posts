### React Test

We have provided a simple React application with 2 pages:
<ul>
<li>A “Posts” page that lists the titles of a user’s posts.</li>
<li>A “User Details” page that displays some information about the active user.</li>
</ul>

We’ve used a publicly available [API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).

Please add the following:

1. A dropdown in the top right corner of the application that allows us to select the active user.</li>
2. The ability to click on a post in the “Posts” page and expand it to see the post body.</li>
3. A search bar in the “Posts” page that matches the design specified [here](https://www.figma.com/design/4Lhm0Oj7EXsKzXvp7OIDEB/search-bar?node-id=0-1&t=GjAOQlc4I8XLUAQf-1).</li>
4. Any single test that checks whether the search bar is working as expected.</li>

We've used [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) for some of the components. You can use that or any other libraries you choose to complete the steps above.

To start the application run <code>npm install</code>, and then <code>npm start</code>.

We recommend spending about 2 hours on this task. If there is anything you missed or would have done differently given more time, feel free to comment what you would have done, or bring it up with us in the technical interview.
